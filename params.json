{"name":"Gnucash for Android","tagline":"Your finances in your pocket!","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nGnuCash Android is a companion expense-tracker application for GnuCash (desktop) designed for Android.\r\nIt allows you to record transactions on-the-go and later import the data into GnuCash for the desktop. \r\n\r\nThe application supports Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread (API level 10) and above.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n\r\n  * An easy-to-use interface.\r\n\r\n  * Chart of Accounts: A master account can have a hierarchy of detail accounts underneath it.  \r\n    This allows similar account types (e.g. Cash, Bank, Stock) to be grouped into one master account (e.g. Assets).\r\n\r\n  * Split Transactions: A single transaction can be split into several pieces to record taxes, fees, and other compound entries.\r\n\r\n  * Double Entry: Every transaction must debit one account and credit another by an equal amount. \r\n    This ensures that the \"books balance\": that the difference between income and outflow exactly\r\n    equals the sum of all assets, be they bank, cash, stock or other.\r\n\r\n  * Income/Expense Account Types (Categories): These serve not only to categorize your cash flow, but when used properly with the double-entry feature, these can provide an accurate Profit&Loss statement.\r\n\r\n  * Scheduled Transactions: GnuCash has the ability to automatically create and enter transactions.\r\n\r\n  * Export to GnuCash XML, QIF or OFX. Also, scheduled exports to 3rd-party sync services like DropBox and Google Drive\r\n\r\n  * Reports: View summary of transactions (income and expenses) as pie/bar/line charts\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nThere are different ways to get the GnuCash app for Android; through the app store, or building it yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### App Store\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gnucash.android\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Android app on Google Play\" src=\"http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\n### With Gradle\r\n\r\nThis project requires the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)\r\nto be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set\r\nthe `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK. For example:\r\n\r\n    export ANDROID_HOME=/home/<user>/tools/android-sdk\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:\r\n\r\n* Run `gradlew build installDevelopmentDebug` from the within the project folder.\r\nIt will build the project for you and install it to the connected Android device or running emulator.\r\n\r\nThe app is configured to allow you to install a development and production version in parallel on your device.\r\n\r\n### With Android Studio\r\nThe easiest way to build is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) v1.+\r\nwith [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/) v2.2.1.\r\nOnce installed, then you can import the project into Android Studio:\r\n\r\n1. Open `File`\r\n2. Import Project\r\n3. Select `build.gradle` under the project directory\r\n4. Click `OK`\r\n\r\nThen, Gradle will do everything for you.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThere are several ways you could contribute to the development.\r\n\r\n* One way is providing translations for locales which are not yet available, or improving translations.\r\nSee this [blog post](http://www.codinguser.com/2012/09/gnucash-for-android-beta-2-lost-in-translation/) for some guidelines.\r\n\r\n* You could as well contribute code, fixing bugs, new features or automated tests. Pull requests are always welcome.\r\nTake a look at the [bug tracker](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/issues?state=open)\r\nfor ideas where to start.\r\n\r\nFor development, it is recommended to use the Android Studio for development which is available for free.\r\nImport the project into the IDE using the build.gradle file. The IDE will resolve dependencies automatically.\r\n\r\n#Licence\r\nGnuCash Android is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the Apache license, version 2.0.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and \r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
